Z0idburg for providing some codebase and for teaching me stuff.

[Zen1th](https://github.com/zenith391/) for creating an improved fork of OCLinux. Some of his code is integrated into the kernel instead of merging due to the code cleanup. His fork is now officially different from the original is being developed independently.
